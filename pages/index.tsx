      <p>
        Over the last 6 years, I have gained tremendous knowledge in many
        aspects of software engineering. I have extensive experience defining
        technical architecture and building products, even with minimal
        requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a true passion for creating amazing products and architecting
        software solutions, I&amp;ve managed to start as a solo engineer and
        build that into a team of 15. My skillset is wide and I learn quickly.
        I&amp;m always willing to take on a new challenge!
